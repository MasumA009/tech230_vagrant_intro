4 Pillars of DevOps: 
1)Ease of use: tools need to be user friendly, which reduces problems down the line
2)Flexibility: in an effort to keep up-to-date with the industry, everything the company uses should be easily changed/ updated
3)Robustness: tools need to have an uptime as close to 100% as possible, this is the responsibility for DevOps engineers 
4)Cost: the company needs to be as efficient as possible, which lowers the cost for the business

monolith: top of the structure, contains everything essentially, it breaks intto 2 tier, where apps are kept

Good Development environments: 1)User friendly, fast, robust. 2) easy to update. 
3)Should match production environment, (makes bugs easy to fix). 
4) should be the same for everyone, makes troubleshooting better
5) only support 1 application, no conflict.
